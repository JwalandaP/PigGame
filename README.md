a quick look at: https://jwalandap.github.io/PigGame/
Instructions: It is a game that can be played between two players. The one who reaches to 100 first wins. The number keeps on adding as you keeping on rolling the dice. If you rolled the dice at 1, the active player shifts to the other one and your current score becomes 0. But if you do not want to take the risk you have an option to hold.
